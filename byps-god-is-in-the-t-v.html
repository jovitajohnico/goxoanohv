Yes, lust is a common and a terrible sin that does interfere with our relationship with God. And yes, if you completely give in to it and deny the Lord, it can cost you more than you even know. However, there is a continuous problem I see on this sub where people act as if lust is bigger than the love of God. Jesus died on the cross for your sin, all of them. Yet you are white. James R.

The question at hand is whether or not it is God's will for his people to suffer sicknesses. I'm of the belief that it is not and this post is my Biblically supported defense of that belief. The reason I feel the need to make a post out of this is that I believe the church is holding onto some very dangerous and completely.

We could go on forever about the inconsistencies sprinkled throughout the bible, and I would love to, but I want to talk about the inconsistencies that you're hit with right out of the gate. The Pentateuch has an abundance of inconsistencies; it's insane. And these were all supposedly written by the same guy? Alright, then. If you say so. When I had read the bible with newly discovered sense of skepticism, I ignored these inconsistencies and absolutely factual inaccuracies and pressed Simon Oliver. God.TV. 825 likes.

I said “no, why would I want to believe in a homophobic, sexist, powerhungry genocidal tyrant”. He said: It says that in the bible but he’s not actually like that (or something along those lines) I think it’s ridiculous that in this case; all of the evidence you could ever try to produce for the existence of God is in the bible or other religious literature.

Thought it may be cool to get a little survey of experiences and associations here. For me, God is in the Radio was one of my favorite songs right after I broke up with my ex. So, I listened to it a lot when walking to and from school. I was especially focused on just listening to it and thinking of nothing else just to escape my head for a bit. I realized I had that association today after hearing it for the first time in a while. I also associate The Evil has Landed with my bass teacher. Who is God? Is He the Creator? Is He responsible for all the death and suffering in the world? What about Jesus Christ, Satan, and angels and demons. Preface: Post whatever thoughts you would like to share, but, what I am hoping for is for someone to specify which exact premise(s) on which exact argument(s) either are unsubstantiatable/unsubstantiated (making the argument unsound), or to explain how the specific premises do not logically flow (making the argument invalid).

# " Who is Jesus ?" (https://i.imgur.com/p83qclJ.png) This is the question of so many. From Atheists to Catholics to Muslims and Hindus, and even many professing Born Again Christians have trouble putting a finger on the exact explanation. " He's the Son of God " that is true - " He is the Christ Messiah " that is true as well - " He is the Saviour " that is what He is yes.but what else? There is one specific thing about Jesus that sets Him apart from all other religions, and not understa. God is the ultimate Being of beings, self-existent, eternal and unchangeable.
